**a) Purpose of the Program(s):** The purpose of the character program is to have a void function that takes a string as input, and will calculate the number of numeric characters, lower case characters, upper case characters, and symbols contained in the string and displays them to the user.

The purpose of the poem program is to have a function that takes an acrostic as the input and will return the secret message to the user.

**b) Input:** The character program's input is the string input and the provided information. The poem program's input is the acrostic input and the provided information.

**c) Expected Output:** The character program's output is the number of numeric characters, lower case characters, upper case characters, and symbols contained in the string. The poem program is a secret message from the given information.

**d) Type of Execution:** The type(s) of execution for the character and poem program is Conditional execution.

**e) Possible Improvements:** The character program could be improved by: Adding written code to handle unexpected errors or adding input validation to check if the user entered the expected string.  

The poem program could be improved by: making it possible for the user to input their acrostic poem. I could also add explanations in my program for what each part does.
